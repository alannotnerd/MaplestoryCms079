These portals will transport you to other rooms where you'll (hopefully) find the exit. Pietri will be waiting at the exit, so all you need to do is talk to him, and he'll let you out. Break all the boxes located in the room, and a monster inside the box will drop a coupon. After escaping the maze, you will be awarded with EXP based on the coupons collected. Additionally, if the leader possesses at least 30 coupons, then a special gift will be presented to the party. If you cannot escape the maze within the allotted " + time + " minutes, you will receive 0 EXP for your time in the maze. If you decide to log off while you're in the maze, you will be automatically kicked out of the maze. Even if the members of the party leave in the middle of the quest, the remaining members will be able to continue on with the quest. If you are in critical condition and unable to hunt down the monsters, you may avoid them to save yourself. Your fighting spirit and wits will be tested! Good luck!");
